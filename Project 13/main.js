// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var favCars = ["Abarth T140", "B Bajaj Lite", "Beechcraft Plainsman", "C Castagna Imperial Landaulet"];
for (var i = 0; i < favCars.length; i++) {
    console.log("I Would like to get", favCars[i]);
}
