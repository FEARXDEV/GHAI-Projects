//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guests = ["Hamza", "Ali", "Hammad"];
// Loop through the guest list and print invitations
for (var _i = 0, guests_1 = guests; _i < guests_1.length; _i++) {
